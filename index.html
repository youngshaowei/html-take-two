      <h1 class="title">The Greatest Love Story</h1>
      <p id="introTop">Once upon a time, my parents didn't know each other existed. 
      <br><br>
      Two different people from two different places and ways of life. Ordinarily, they would have never met if it weren't for a blind date of fate.</p>

      <h2>My Mother</h2>
      <p>My mother was born in Malaysia and the youngest of five. The area was considered underdeveloped and her family was in poverty. Therefore, life was harder for her than most. She worked hard in school and because that's what she needed to do to survive. Besides, the school system as harder: if you failed a class, you failed a whole grade and had to retake it. My mother was the only one of her siblings to not retake a whole grade.

      To make a better living, she researched schools in the United States. Of all the college she looked at, only one caught her eye: Southern Illinois University in Edwardsville (SIUE). The reason: They didn't ask for an essay. Easy enough, right?</p>

      <h2>My Father</h2>
      <p>My father grew up in Texas. His parents (my grandparents) were teachers but they moved a lot. Almost every single year, he went to a new school and had to make new friends.
      <br><br>
      My dad was also the son of teachers. That's sounds awesome, but it wasn't. To be honest, having teachers as parents made his life hell, especially since my grandpa was not the nicest. So, my dad was bullied quite a lot.
      <br><br>
      Luckily, when it came to college, his aunt lived in St. Louis and offered to have him stay there as he went to college. SIUE happened to be a commute away, so it looked like a viable option. 
      <br><br>
      Plus, it got him away from his parents.

      <h2>Before They Met</h2>
      <p>Other than my father's infatuation with Asian culture, they had no reason to know each other. But, college brings people of different backgrounds and goals together, sometimes. Turns out, one of their mutual friends decided that they should meet. She decided that a blind date was in order. It took some trying to get it to work, and some sheer dumb luck. Well, if dumb luck is equivalent to tenacity on my dad's side. But, we'll get to that later.

      <h2>The Blind Date</h2>
      <p>Both of my parents agreed to go on this date. My mom got to the location first, and was looking for my dad. Well, she didn't have a lot of details, other than his name. As she was looking around, a man approached her and asked if her name was Chai. She said yes, but then it clicked. Just, not in a good way.
      <bv><br>
      To reiterate, my mother is from Malaysia. She is of Chinese descent.
      <br><br>
      My father... is not.
      <br><br>
      And the only reason she went on this date was because her date's name was supposedly Lee Young.
      <br><br>
      Well, Lee Young was a white boy from Texas, not Chinese like she thought.
      <br><br>
      So, she left.

      <h2>The Pursuit</h2>
      <p>My dad liked her. Their date didn't turn out like he had wanted, with her leaving, but he understood. My mom was expecting an Asian man, and that clearly wasn't him.
      <br><br>
      But, he wanted to give them a shot. So, he did his best to get her attention. He joined her friends circle (all Asian, by the way) and volunteered for ANY event for the Asian community.
      <br><br>
      As a result, he no longer can look at egg rolls the same way after making thousands of them.
      <br><br>
      After many mothers of trying, she gave him a second chance. A second date.

      <h2>The Second Date</h2>
      <p>The chance for redemption. Another shot at love. My dad went to pick up my mom and take her to a restaurant, which my mom was excited for. She had dressed up pretty and was looking forward to a night of romance.
      <br><br>
      Well, dad showed up looking casual with an untucked shirt. Okay, this could be a fluke. Maybe he would do well at the date.
      <br><br>
      They show up at the restaurant and it's packed. Of course, my dad did NOT make a reservation.
      <br><br>
      So, Arby's it was.
      <br><br>
      My dad didn't think it was a big deal, but by this point my mother was very disappointed in the whole thing. She didn't want Arby's! She wanted a romantic date! And my dad WASN'T it.
      <br><br>
      Well, that's what happens when he forgets it was Valentine's Day.

      <h2>The Apology</h2>
      <p>My dad really screwed up, and he knew it. The next day, he showed up at her door and begged for her forgiveness. It took some convincing, but he did manage to get her to open her door. When she did, he was holding a stuffed kitty as a gift.
      <br><br>
      I don't know exactly what he said, but it must have worked because I'm here!
      <br><br>
      And, to this day, I still have the kitty :)
